# Human Activity Classification Based on Micro Doppler Signatures

Two human activity data sets based on Micro-Doppler Doppler radar are available (name as Data1 and Data2, respectively). Data1 contains I / Q channels and Data2 contains only I channel.  
Data1 can be downloaded as follows:

## Description:  
Doppler radar was used to collect data on seven types of human daily activities: running, walking, walking while holding a stick, crawling, boxing while moving forward, boxing while standing in place, and sitting still.  
  
Action type  | Description
---- | -----  
Running  |  The act of quickly advancing by swinging arms and legs.
Walking  |  The act of walking forward at a moderate speed while moving arms and legs.
Walking while holding a stick  | The act of holding the stick in a horizontal position with both hands while walking.
Crawling  | The act of crawling forward on the ground with both hands and knees.
Boxing while moving forward  | The act of punching with two hands while walking.
Boxing while standing in place  | Stand still and engage in punching.
Sitting still  | Sitting in a chair, there are slight restless movements, such as shaking his legs, touching his hair, and crossing his hands.  

Data1 was collected on seven people: hq, gj, xl, zy, dh, jp, hx. Data2 was collected on four people: hq, gj, xl, dh.  
Each data is named as: a*, b*, c*....The 'a' indicates that the data was collected for the first time, 'b' is the second time, and so on.  
The collection details of Data1 and Data2 are explained in [1] and [2], respectively. Data1 was used for experiments by [1,3]. And Data2 was used for experiments by [2,4].
